## Where are you from?

I am from the suburbs of Chicago 40 minutes away, in Gurnee.

##IT interest

I am interested mainly in mobile programming. I am very interested on how apps on the phone are made, and I would want to be able to make one of my own.

##Something interesting about me

I am very into cars, sneakers, clothes, video games, and I love the Bulls. I have two younger siblings, one is seven, and the other just turned one.
